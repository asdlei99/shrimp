May 18 2005		version 0.4.2
				fixed some bugs in blocks.
				added wood block supplied by Luis Barrancos.

May 17 2004		version 0.4.1
				included ambientlight.sl and distantlight.sl,
				they're compiled with preview shader.
				Added patch to compile with GCC 3.3.
				Code cleanup, little fixes.

May 12 2004		version 0.4
				included SDP libraries in Shrimp package.

Feb 22 2001		version 0.3.4
				now has a more flexible way of setting a pad's
				value. 
				should compile cleanly with newer compilers now.
				
Dec 3 2000		version 0.3.3
				just a bug fix this time. it seems shrimp wasn't
				creating the prefs file correctly and as a 
				consequence the preview didn't work.
				
Oct 30 2000		version 0.3.2
				moving a block can be initiated just by left-
				clicking on it.
				added a code preview so you can see the shader
				code shrimp will generate, but be warned, it's
				not pretty.
				input pad values are now displayed in the 
				status bar as the mouse moves over them.
				added a stripe block and a checker example.

Oct 6 2000		version 0.3.1
				A few changes to the interface to make it faster
				to use: added keyboard shortcuts to common 
				functions, pads no longer need to be 
				disconnected before connecting them to 
				something else.
				The preview now runs in a separate process.

Oct 3 2000		version 0.3.0
				This adds a proper preview, all done from
				inside shrimp. A number of options can be set
				via the new Render Options dialog. These are
				not saved (maybe next release).
				The shader properties dialog allows some notes
				to be saved along with the circuit file. 

Sep 29 2000		version 0.2.1
				just a few more blocks in this one.
				
Sep 24 2000		version 0.2.0
				blocks can have a variable number of inputs.
				many new blocks written.
				file related functions changed to be more
				windoze friendly. 
				The revision number moved up quite a lot to
				more accuratly reflect the state of the project.

Sep	16 2000		version 0.0.7
				quite a few function blocks have been added
				menus added to the interface for them.

Sep 3 2000:		version 0.0.6
				pad values and type can now be set via the
				ioproperties dialog.
				type mismatch is reported when trying to 
				connect incompatible types. 
				(but complains when eg connecting a vector to 
				a normal. have to use a cast for the moment)

Aug 30 2000:	version 0.0.5
				loading and saving of circuits implemented
				
Aug 26 2000:	version 0.0.4
				basic code generation working.

Aug 24 2000: 	version 0.0.3
				basic editing of blocks, loading, moving
				deleting, connecting/disconnecting all
				operational.
				
Aug 17 2000: 	work commences.
