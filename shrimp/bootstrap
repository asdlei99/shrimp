Bootstrapping Shrimp ...

This script uses aclocal, automake, autoconf, and libtool
to generate configuration and makefiles for building
the project.  It is intended for use by developers who
obtain the source via CVS.  If you obtained Shrimp via
source tarball you shouldn't need to run this script,
since the generated files are normally included in a
tarball distribution.

Bootstrap complete ... next, run

	./configure

to set build options.  Note: by default, the build will
create binaries with debugging symbols (-g) and moderate
optimization (-O2) enabled.  This is default behavior for
autoconf, and can be overridden by specifying CFLAGS and
CXXFLAGS when you run configure, e.g.

	CFLAGS="-O3" CXXFLAGS="-O3" ./configure

for a build with more aggressive optimization and
no debugging symbols. Run

	./configure --help

for details on these and other available options.
