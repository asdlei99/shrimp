<usage>Returns the data associated with the current ray, as long as the data is known to the renderer and of correct type, in which case result will contain the associated data content, and rayinfo() will exit with 1.0, otherwise rayinfo() will exit with 0. The data accessible by the rayinfo() call is listed next, as well as its type, and brief description: "speculardepth", uniform float; "diffusedepth", uniform float; "shadowdepth", uniform float, 1 if this is a shadow ray, 0 otherwise; "depth", uniform float, the total depth of the current ray, being speculardepth + diffusedepth + shadowdepth, but have in mind that this is 0 for camera rays; "type", uniform string, which returns the ray type, being one of the following: "camera", "light", "specular", "diffuse", "subsurface", "transmission", "march"; "label", uniform string, returns the label associated with the current ray, if any is set; "origin", uniform point, returns the origin of the ray, which for camera rays is equivalent to E; "direction", varying vector, returns the length of the associated ray, which for camera rays is equivalent to I. Notice that different renderer implementations of rayinfo() might be able to access different data fields.</usage>
