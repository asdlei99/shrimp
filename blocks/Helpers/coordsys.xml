<usage>A simple reference block, that outputs all presets coordinate systems, to be more precise: "current", the default coordinate system; "object" , the coordinate system in which the primitive is declared; "shader", the coordinate system in which the shader is declared; "world", the coordinate system active at RiWorldBegin; "camera", the coordinate system of the camera with the positive z pointing forward, positive x pointing to the right, and positive y pointing up; "screen", a perspective corrected coordinate system of the camera's image plane, with range defined by RiScreenWindow; "raster", the 2D projected space of the image, with upper-left corner of the image as 0,0, and xy increasing towards their maximum values as specified by RiFormat; "NDC", the Normalized Device Coordinates. Like "raster" space, but x and y goes from 0 to 1 across the whole image, in other words: NDC(x) = raster(x) / Xres and NDC(y) = raster(y) / Yres.</usage>
