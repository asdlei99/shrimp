    <code>
    $(P) = P;
    </code>
	<usage>Note that in all shaders types, P is the surface position, the only exception being volume shaders, in which P is the light ray origin. Also note that in imager shaders, P is the position of the pixel center in raster space, with the z coordinate being 0.</usage>
